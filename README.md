# Make tweets great again

In this project for the Deep Learning course (WMAI18002) at University of Groningen we generated fake Donald Trump tweets using an [AWD LSTM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02182) and a [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). 

## Instructions for usage
1. Make a new virtual environment in Python >= 3.6
2. Install the dependencies mentioned in `requirements.txt` with your package manager
3. Run `main.py` with your Python 3, a built in help function is provided with the flag `-h`

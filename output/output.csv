"John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed, bringing down the world and ruining people's lives. A total failure!"
"Once John Kasich announced he was running for president, and opened his mouth, people realized he was a complete & total dud!"
"John Kasich fell right into President Obama’s trap on ObamaCare, and the people of Ohio are suffering for it. Shame!"
Doesn’t help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else - he’s almost last.
"I loved beating John Kasich in the debates, but it was easy—he came in dead last!"
Kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down. People from NH are smart!
Watch Kasich squirm --- if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun!
"I want to do negative ads on John Kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don’t want to waste my money."
"John Kasich, despite being Governor of Ohio, is losing to me in the Ohio polls. Pathetic!"
"John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image, not negative ads on me."
"Governor Kasich, whose failed campaign & debating skills have brought him way down in the polls, is going to spend $2.5 million against me."

I wonder what the rest of the world is thinking about the United States as they watch the disgusting and out of control Baltimore riots?
"Hopefully there won't be any problems in Baltimore tonight. Be calm, be cool-do not let anybody get hurt.There is just too much to live for!"
"The best social program, by far, is a JOB! Our jobs are being taken away from us by China and many other countries - incompetent leader."
"President Obama, you have a big job to do. Go to Baltimore and bring both sides together. With proper leadership, it can be done! Do it."
"Our country has to come together. We have to start working with, and really liking, each other. The whole world is watching Baltimore."
"""@Vanderpunked: Can we drop @realDonaldTrump off in the middle of #Baltimore so he can show Obama how it's done?"" I would fix it fast!"
"The Mayor of Baltimore said she wanted to give the rioters ""space to destroy"" - another real genius!"
"Now that the ineffective Baltimore Police have allowed the city to be destroyed, are the U.S. taxpayers expected to rebuild it (again)?"
Our great African American President hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore!
Blatant and rampant property destruction in Baltimore as the police stand by and watch. Should be a lesson on how NOT to handle riots. SAD!
"Wow, 15 policemen hurt in Baltimore, some badly! Where is the National Guard. Police must get tough, and fast! Thugs must be stopped."

China has a backdoor into the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This deal does not address currency manipulation. China is laughing at us.
